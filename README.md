# Bunnyshell Connectors

This is a repository containing connectors for [Bunnyshell's platform](https://www.bunnyshell.com/).

You can think of connectors as a way to do a shallow integration between Bunnyshell and other platforms.

These connectors contain the scripts, as well as the Component configurations needed to connect Bunnyshell with other platforms.
